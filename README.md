# Evaluating-Smart-Contract-Security-Tools-Powered-By-AI

## Repository 
Contracts in this repo are vulnerable by design and should not be used in production. Their only purpose is educational-for depicting how certain vulnerabilities could be exploited.


## MSc Disseration Paper
The repository also includes a dissertation entitled "Testing the Accuracy of AI Tools that Specialize in Providing Security for Smart Contracts written in Solidity and Deployed on Ethereum-Based Blockchains." It goes into great detail about various traditional and AI-powered tools available for the security of smart contracts, reviews their effectiveness in finding vulnerabilities within the smart contracts, and provides a comparison between the well-established traditional tools and AI-powered tools to find any potential future improvements for these up and coming tools.


## Acknowledgments
Above all, particular thanks are owed to my supervisor, Dr. Pascal Berrang, who assisted with the review of the research and providing indispensable guidance throughout this dissertation development.
