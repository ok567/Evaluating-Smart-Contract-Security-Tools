# Evaluating-Smart-Contract-Security-Tools

## Repository 
Contracts in this repo are vulnerable by design and should not be used in production. Their only purpose is educational-for depicting how certain vulnerabilities could be exploited.


## MSc Disseration Paper
This repository includes a dissertation entitled "Testing the Accuracy of AI Tools that Specialize in Providing Security for Smart Contracts written in Solidity and Deployed on Ethereum-Based Blockchains." It goes into great detail about the various AI tools available for the security of smart contracts and also reviews their effectiveness in finding vulnerabilities within the smart contracts.


## Acknowledgments
Above all, particular thanks are owed to my supervisor, Dr. Pascal Berrang, who assisted with the review of the research and providing indispensable guidance throughout this dissertation development.
