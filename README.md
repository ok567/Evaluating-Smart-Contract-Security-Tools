# Evaluating-Smart-Contract-Security-Tools-Powered-By-AI

## Repository 
Contracts in this repo are vulnerable by design and should not be used in production. Their only purpose is educational-for depicting how certain vulnerabilities could be exploited.


## MSc Disseration Paper
The repository also includes a dissertation entitled "Testing the Accuracy of AI Tools that Specialize in Providing Security for Smart Contracts written in Solidity and Deployed on Ethereum-Based Blockchains." It goes into great detail about various traditional and AI-powered tools available for the security of smart contracts, reviews their effectiveness in finding vulnerabilities within the smart contracts, and provides a comparison between the well-established traditional tools and AI-powered tools to find any potential future improvements for these up and coming tools.

## Tools Chosen
AI tools selected for this research were chosen based on their availability and accessibility, since there was only a small selection of open-sourced ones that I could have access to without any financial constrains. Though there are some other advanced AI-powered smart contract security tools, many of those have been commercialized and hence can only be made available upon making payments or paying subscription fees, thus limiting their availability to purely academic research. Thus, this paper focused the investigation on free-access tools, which was an affordable way to assess how AI can improve blockchain security.

**AI-powered Security Tools**:

Static Analysis - **OlympiX**: An AI-driven security analysis tool that performs deep static analysis to detect vulnerabilities in smart contract.

Dynamic Analysis - **Fuzzland**: An AI-powered fuzzing tool that tests smart contracts by injecting random inputs mimicking real-world scenarios to uncover hidden vulnerabilities and edge cases.

Formal Verification - **ZAN SCR**: Utilises AI to mathematically verify that smart contracts adhere to their intended specifications.

**Traditional Security Tools**:

Static Analysis - **Oyente**: A traditional static analysis tool for smart contracts.

Dynamic Analysis - **Echidna**: A fuzzer that systematically generates and tests a wide range of inputs to identify vulnerabilities and ensure contract robustness.

Formal Verification - **VeriSol**: A formal verification tool used to mathematically prove the correctness of smart contracts.
